## Culture, Race, Ethnicity, and Nationality Ontology

This work undertakes the possibility of using the Web Ontology Language (OWL2) to describe concepts related to "culture", "race", "ethnicity", and "nationality" - concepts that are sometimes misunderstood/misused due to lack of standarization and biases. The project also attempts to link data relating to these broad concepts to health data, like cancer rates, and shed light on understanding health disparaties that impact certain communities.
